# Basic course of data analysis (and a little bit more) using Python.
This repo is my humble contribution to put some useful information that I have gathered while working with Python and data analysis.

# Section 1
Introduction to Python: installation, programming structure, main packages, and Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

# Section 2
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Section 3
Data visualization

Sometimes it's tricky to choose the right graph to display your data. I like the guide in [data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)

# Section 4
Machine learning models
